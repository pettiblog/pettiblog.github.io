Hi, I'm **Nick**, and I like Data, Science, Business and coffee. Mostly coffee.

Here at PettiBlog you'll find a recollection of facts, tips and opinions based on my professional experience in the Pharma and Healthcare Communications industry regarding subjects and issues that are of interest to us cool geeky entrepreneurs.

I started this blog as a means to start working on the web. I always knew I would work with computers, and until recently I was a user more than a programmer. So after completing my degree I decided to take a Master's in my most challenging subject: Computational Biology. Yet, literally a million cool things happened throughout that year, including learning code, web design, graphic design and hardcore data analysis.

I like code, science and business as much as I like writing about it, so be sure to check out some of my work in my [Portfolio](http://www.pettiblog.com/portfolio).

If you enjoy the content found here feel free to [send me](mailto:nicolaspettican@gmail.com) any suggestions, comments or feedback as I would appreciate this very much!

Gracias!
