"Hello World!", who even came up with that? Actually I just [googled it](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/602237/where-does-hello-world-come-from), it was Brian Kernighan. Amazing isn't it, how nowadays we can just take our phones from our pockets and have access to basically all the knowledge humans have acquired throughout the centuries. And my overgrown curiosity can now be quenched, or made worse, depending on how you look at it. I guess I could say I'm the kind of person that never stops, I can get bored easily if I am not doing something productive. So even when I am on the bus I'll either have my laptop with me to do some programming or web -design, or have my phone to read about something that peeked my interest.

The result? Some friends have called me Nikipedia, I'll just leave it at that. I wasn't always like this though, in fact I kind of had the gene in me but it never got expressed due to my environment. You see, I was brought up in a very warm sea-side town in Spain, one it's inhabitants call "el culo del mundo" (the backside of the World), the kind of place where you can get very comfortable and not feel the need to better yourself. I mean, what for? But thank the universe I had the opportunity to come to Manchester. It opened my eyes! It opened doors, windows, you name it. And I ran head-first into them. I'm not too proud of that though; I mean I have dived into the deep end in many an occassion; but luckily (with a lot of hard work) I managed to triumph. 

As they say: we learn from our mistakes and move forward. And as I always say: we can achieve so much if we only got rid of that laziness. Actually my mum says that. A lot. So much that it is now stuck in my head and whenever I am being lazy I can hear my mum's voice in my head, which makes me find something productive to do. 

I do take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all.
